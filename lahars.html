            What is a lahar?
        </p>
        <p class = 'Main_text_1'>
            A lahar is a dangerous flowing mixture of water, volcanic rock, mud, 
            and other debris (such as trees, vehicles, parts of buildings - whatever 
            the lahar can pick up). These hazardous flows originate on a volcano, 
            travelling rapidly down the flanks and into river valleys. They are 
            capable of major destruction of buildings and infrastructure due to 
            forceful impact or burial. There's no overstating how dangerous lahars 
            are - 20% of the deaths associated with volcanic eruptions worldwide are 
            due to lahars. While lahars contain a lot of water, they are not like 
            normal river floods. They contain a huge amount of mud, and this mud is 
            left behind when the lahar stops. This mud then dries and sets a bit 
            like concrete, making clean up and salvage very challenging. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There is no safe amount of exposure to a lahar - <u>you must get out of the way</u>.

            Why do lahars happen?
        </p> <p class = 'Main_text_1'>
            Lahars are caused by a range of things. Small lahars can happen 
            quite frequently inside Mt Rainier National Park, caused by intense 
            rainfall or seasonal snowmelt - these typically stay within the 
            National Park boundaries and are referred to as ‘debris flows’. 
            Larger lahars, with the potential of reaching populated areas, 
            may be caused by the melting of massive quantities of snow and 
            ice during an eruption. Alternatively, they may be caused by the 
            collapse of part of the mountain. Larger lahars are rare and are 
            most likely to occur during an eruption - this is good because there 
            is usually some warning before an eruption. However, there is some 
            evidence to suggest that lahars are possible without an eruption, 
            known as ‘No-Notice Lahars’. This type of lahar could happen unexpectedly, 
            so it is important to know how to prepare and respond to a lahar. If you 
            want to learn more about lahars, go to the <a class = 'MainText' href = '#MoreAboutLahars'>More About Lahars</a> page.

            Are you in the Lahar Zone?

        <p class = 'Main_text_1'>
            Major lahars from Mt Rainier are rare. Evidence suggests 60 
            have happened in the last 10,000 years - the most recent one, 
            called the Electron Mudflow, happened about 500 years ago.
            These lahars have affected the Puyallup, White, Carbon, and 
            Nisqually River Valleys, all of which are now home to someone.
            You can learn more about the history of lahars in the Puget
            Sound Lowlands by going to the <a class = 'MainText' href =
             '#MoreAboutLahars'>More About Lahars</a> page. 
            The Cascades Volcano Observatory (part of the United States 
            Geological Survey) has set up a Lahar Early Warning System to help
            protect people in the event of a lahar. It has also used computer 
            simulations to estimate the areas that could be affected by a lahar.
            This is shown in the map below - see how a lahar could reach a 
            populated area like Orting in around an hour.

            Do you live, work, or go to school in the Lahar Zone?
            <br>
            <br>
            Use the map below to find out. The map shows the areas 
            that could be affected by a worst case scenario lahar.
            The map works like any other Google Map - you can zoom in
            and out, and move around to look for important places for
            you and your family. If you do find yourself in the Lahar 
            Zone, either often or just occasionally, please look at the
            <a class = 'MainText' href = 'prepare.html'>Prepare</a> page to learn how to protect yourself and
            your loved ones.
