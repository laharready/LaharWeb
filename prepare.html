            If a lahar comes flowing down the hill with full force and velocity, your chances of survival are 
            best if you have prepared. The <u>good news</u> is that many of the ways to prepare for a lahar are 
            the same for other emergencies.
            <br>
            <br>
            The best place to find up to date information about being prepared for any emergency is the 
            <a class = 'MainText' href = 'https://mil.wa.gov/preparedness'>Washington State Emergency Management 
                Division Preparedness</a> website.
            <br>
            <br>
            This page describes three important things you can do to stay prepared.
        </p>
        <p class = 'Subtitle_1'>
            1) Sign up for alerts - it's free!
        </p>
        <div class = Nest_rows_Evac>
            <div class = Nest_rows_Prep_c1>
                <p class = 'Main_text_2'>
                    Pierce County has an emergency alert system. It is <u>free to sign up</u> and you can
                    receive alerts by text, email, or phone. You can choose the types of alerts you want to receive and
                    the locations you want to receive them for, e.g., where you live, where you work, your children's school.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sign up for Pierce County Alerts <a class = 'MainText' href = 'https://www.piercecountywa.gov/921/Pierce-County-ALERT'>HERE</a>. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you are in an area affected by a lahar, and you have cell reception, you may also receive a Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) by 
                    text message, even if you haven't signed up for alerts.
                </p>  
            </div>
            <div class = Nest_rows_Prep_c2>
                <img src = 'Alert PNG.png' class = Nest_rows_Prep_c2>
            </div>    
        </div>
        <p class = 'Subtitle_1'>
            2) Know your evacuation routes.
        </p>
        <p class = 'Main_text_1'>
            If a lahar happens, you must get out of the lahar zone immediately - <u>you may only have minutes to evacuate</u>.
            <br>
            <br>
            A great way to make sure you know where to go is to learn and practice your evacuation sroutes. On the 
            <a class = 'MainText' href = 'evacuate.html'>Evacuate</a> page, you can learn more about how to evacuate, and at 
            the bottom of the page you will find maps of the lahar zones and evacuation routes for each community, e.g., Orting,
            Puyallup, Sumner, etc.
        </p>
        <p class = 'Subtitle_1'>
            3) Get a Go-Bag.
        </p>
        <p class = 'Main_text_1'>
            In the event of a lahar, evacuation needs to happen very quickly.
            <br>
            <br>
            Packing can slow you down. To save time, make yourself a Go-Bag -- get your family members to make one too. This bag should
            contain items that are essential and helpful for your surivial outside your home for a few days. The diagram below shows
            some of the things you might want to include in your Go-Bag.
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="EmergencyKit_2.png" alt="Emergency Kit" class="EmergencyKit_1">
        </div>
        <p class = 'Main_text_1'>
            If you can, it's a good idea to have multiple Go-Bags. For example, one for your home, one for your car, and one for your
            workplace.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lahars commonly occur with volcanic eruptions, so your Go-Bag should also include things that will help you deal with
            volcanic ash, e.g., a face mask, gloves, and goggles.
            <br>
            <br>
            Having a pre-arranged place to stay for a while, such as a friend's of family member's house, is also a good idea.
