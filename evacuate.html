                    In the event of a lahar, you will hear sirens, activated by the USGS lahar warning 
                    system, and if you have cell signal, you should receive a text alert on your phone. Unless it is announced, you should assume that it is <u>not a drill</u>. If you have signed up 
                    to additional alerts, you should receive a message on your phone.

                            The best way to do this, if you are able-bodied, is to leave <u>on foot</u>.

                            This may feel counterintuitive, but just as you are thinking, 'I must leave fast,

                            consequence? Traffic jams -- these slow everyone down.

                                Because of this, schools are mandated by the State of Washington to prepare robust
                                evacuation plans. These plans are designed to ensure that your children are safely 
                                evacuated in the event of a lahar.

                                People learn how to do something well by <i>doing</i> it many times. This is why 
                                schools are mandated to run lahar evacuation drills regularly. These are either 
                                shelter-in-place drills or full evacuation drills. It is so important for your 
                                child/children to know how to keep themselves safe in case of a lahar emergency 
                                <br>-- Please allow them to take part in drills.

                    staying in or entering the Lahar Zone, especially in your car, is dangerous. Stay safe

                        Orting would be the first city in the path of a lahar - it could reach the city limits in about an hour.

                        <br>
                        Upstream of Orting, a lahar could come from the south along the Puyallup River, or from the north along 
                        the Carbon River and South Praire Creek. A lahar would approach Orting itself from the southeast.

                        <br>
                        Under the worst-case-scenario, the entire valley could be covered in up to 15 feet of mud and debris, 
                         - the whole of Orting would be affected. This means there is no safe place within the city limits 
                         and you must evacuate up the hills to the south west.

                        <br>
                        -- <u>If you are in the main central part of Orting</u>, your best option is to take Callistoga Avenue 
                        West towards the southwest, cross over the Puyallup River, and go past the Abundant Life Church. From 
                        here, either continue straight on along 162nd Avenue East up the hill, or turn right onto Ortin Kapaowskin 
                        Highway East up to the top of the hill.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        -- <u>If you are in the northwest of Orting</u>, follow the 162 out of Orting, cross over the Puyallup River 
                        keep heading northwest until, either: 1) turn right onto McCutcheon Road East following it until Rhodes Lake Road 
                        East, onto which you can turn right and head up hill into Bonney Lake; 2) just beyond McCutcheon Road East, take a 
                        left onto Mililtary Road East and head up the hill.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        -- <u>If you are in the southeast of Orting</u> follow the 162 southeast. You have two options. 1) Turn right 
                        when you reach Orville Road East to the south, you can then take left turns onto either Buttes Drive East or 
                        A. L. Card. Road East, both head up the hill to safety. 2) Keep going along the 162 to the northeast until you 
                        can turn right to join Patterson Road East which will take you up the hill to safety.
